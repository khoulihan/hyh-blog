Something I've had in my mind for a while is to do something based on the Chemical Brothers' song "Where Do I Begin", which I think captures well the feeling of coming down after a trip; the mix of awe and confusion and the tenuous connection to your sense of self.

So I set out to do that, intending it to feature a woman with a coffee cup, like in the song... and somehow got diverted into this close-up portrait. I think I had planned something like [Cosmic Eye][cosmic-eye], where she would have a universe visible in her pupil, but she wasn't really at the necessary scale for that to work.

I further intended to animate the colours, and shift between different palettes in a sort of pulsing manner, but that wasn't working out the way I planned, so I abandoned it.

I guess the most notable feature of this piece is the dithering style, which is sort of rough and incorporates various shapes. I've never tried this style before.

I might need to try this again and stick closer to my original vision...

## Timelapse

I used the recorder feature of [Pixelorama][pixelorama] to capture this timelapse, in the mode that only captures the canvas. I like that the result does not hop around erratically like my previous timelapse, but it does get a bit hard to follow what is actually being worked on at some points when it gets into the finer details, especially the anti-aliasing.
