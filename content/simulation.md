Summary: Thoughts on the simulation argument.
Status: draft

I just done watched [Thought Slime's][tschannel] [video about the simulation argument][tsvideo], and it's a topic about which I've had some thoughts myself, so I thought maybe it was time to write some of them down.

Like comrade Slime, I think that it's an interesting thought experiment, but a lot of what is said about it is poorly thought through at best. It's particularly frustrating when [Nick Bostrom's argument][nbarg] is held up as "proof" of the "certainty" that we are living in a simulation, alongside arguments and assertions that completely contradict it. The argument itself doesn't claim to be proof of any such thing - it presents three possibilities based on premises about which we have almost no information.

## Why would we simulate?

> One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears.

This is Nick's description of *what* futuristic super-computing civilisations would do with their computational power, but he doesn't really get into *why* they might do this. Into this absence people pour all sorts of ideas. A common one is that we are equivalent to NPCs in a video-game. A related one is that we exist so that the simulators can pop in and out of our minds and ride us around for some reason - historical educational purposes perhaps, or the thrill of slumming it in the stupid-ages.

These are interesting concepts for science-fiction, but I don't find them compelling as claims about the reality of our world. Video-games are indeed able to present more visually convincing realities than in the past, but they don't do that by simulating entire physical universes in minute detail. They might run physics simulations for a variety of things in the vicinity of the player - beyond the bare minimum necessary to convince, they are hollow. simplified facades, and anything not relevant to the context of the current gameplay is non-existent. What would it add to a player's experience to have NPCs living lives outside of that context and having inner lives?

Nick Bostrum actually gets into some of the mechanisms that could be used to reduce the computational requirements of a simulation:

> If the environment is included in the simulation, this will require additional computing power – how much depends on the scope and granularity of the simulation. Simulating the entire universe down to the quantum level is obviously infeasible... But in order to get a realistic simulation of human experience, much less is needed – only whatever is required to ensure that the simulated humans, interacting in normal human ways with their simulated environment, don’t notice any irregularities.

> Distant astronomical objects can have highly compressed representations: verisimilitude need extend to the narrow band of properties that we can observe from our planet or solar system spacecraft. On the surface of Earth, macroscopic objects in inhabited areas may need to be continuously simulated, but microscopic phenomena could likely be filled in ad hoc. What you see through an electron microscope needs to look unsuspicious, but you usually have no way of confirming its coherence with unobserved parts of the microscopic world

The implicit assumption here is that the simulation is being made convincing for the benefit of the simulated minds (i.e. us), which always run at full resolution. Video-games are not run for the entertainment of NPCs however. If simulations are being run for the amusement of posthuman "players", and they are interested in reducing the computational requirements, as Nick assumes, why would they not prune the most computationally expensive component - simulated human minds that are not immediately relevant to the player's current experience? Would they even need to simulate fully conscious humans at all to provide convincing NPCs to players?

Nick does suggest something akin to such pruning in his original argument:

> In addition to ancestor-simulations, one may also consider the possibility of more selective simulations that include only a small group of humans or a single individual. The rest of humanity would then be zombies or “shadow-people” – humans simulated only at a level sufficient for the fully simulated people not to notice anything suspicious.

However, it is again expressed as if the purpose of the simulation is solely to fool its unwitting inhabitant(s), with no proposed utility for the creators of the simulation.

I submit to you that if you are experiencing a private and mundane moment right now, and are conscious of it, you are probably not a character simulated on some posthuman equivalent of a PlayStation.

A more reasonable suggestion, to my mind, is that we would run such simulations in order to study our own civilisation at different stages of development, or to see how civilisations might develop under different circumstances. Would these simulations even require fully conscious simulated participants in order to be useful? Would they need to simulate the full lives of everybody who has ever lived? Or would they drastically reduce the number of minds needing to be simulated by cutting out all the boring parts? Would there really even be anything to be learned from such simulations?

This lack of clarity about why a posthuman civilisation would run ancestor simulations is at the heart of a lot of my issues with the argument. Without that understanding, we can't really say whether such a civilisation would run them or not, or how many, or what their parameters would be. It's just sort of assumed that they probably will because it would be a cool thing to be able to do, and some people say they would do it right now if it were possible. But that's an easy thing to say when you don't have to worry about the ethical concerns or the resources involved.

Another type of simulation we might run are of universes with different physical laws, but as the quotes above about simplifying the simulations suggest, these would have a different set of priorities, and wouldn't really qualify as "ancestor simulations". But, more about physics simulations in a minute...

## Simulations Within Simulations

One of the silliest suggestions that some people seem to take seriously is that the posthuman civilisation in the base reality would run simulations beyond the point where the simulated civilisations would be running their own simulations, with those simulations running further simulations, and so on.

Nick likens this scenario to running code in a virtual machine:

> It may be possible for simulated civilizations to become posthuman. They may then run their own ancestor-simulations on powerful computers they build in their simulated universe. Such computers would be “virtual machines”, a familiar concept in computer science. (Java script web-applets, for instance, run on a virtual machine – a simulated computer – inside your desktop.)

His example is terrible, but the basic assertion is correct, a computer can simulate another computer in various ways, with varying levels of overhead. In the best case, code running in the virtual machine runs directly on the host hardware with no translation necessary.

Now, let's think through this scenario a little bit.
