Summary: Movies I watched recently that I have a bit to say about... but not too much.
Status: draft

I've watched a lot of movies recently that I have a bit to say about, but not enough for a big post dissecting them on their own, like Wrong Turn and Ready Player One, so I'm just throwing them all together here.

## Kimi

Kimi is a 2022 psychological thriller about an agoraphobic woman, Angela, who works from home for a smart speaker company - creators of the eponymous "Kimi" - listening to supposedly anonymised audio clips that the speaker's AI couldn't understand. On one of the clips she hears what she believes to be an assault in the background, and when her employers are reluctant to investigate she has to (*gulp*)... leave her apartment!

The main thing that I really liked about this movie was the portrayal of her struggle to leave her apartment, and the paradoxical sense of claustrophobia when she does. I felt much the same at one point in my life and it rang true to me.

On the other hand, when it gets down to *thriller time*, the action is quite repetitive and pointless. She gets captured, escapes, captured again almost straight away, escapes again right outside her building, and then there is somebody waiting for her in her apartment anyway. Boring. It gets better from there, but too late.

One thing I really didn't like was the role of the smart speaker, Kimi. Although the plot early on does highlight a lack of privacy and data protection when Angela is able to find out whose speaker recorded the clips, and obtain further recordings, this is undermined by the plot being fundamentally about solving a murder thanks to the speaker's ubiquitous surveillance. It then takes on a heroic role at the climax when Angela is able to outwit several hired goons by ordering it to do various things like cut the lights and play music and so on. I would say the movie comes down on the side of being pro corporate surveillance.

## Choose or Die

Choose or Die is a 2022 horror thriller about a cursed retro video game. This seemed like a fun premise, but unfortunately the movie as a whole was fucking crap.

My main fault with it is that the game (named CURS>R) has apparently boundless powers to reshape reality to its whims, and that the choices it presents players with are seemingly arbitrary, and differ wildly in terms of their consequences. For example, the first choice the main character, Kayla, is given is between coffee and cake in a diner, with apparently no negative consequences. Another character's first choice is between eating a computer or eating their own arm - both potentially fatal, one would think. For one of the "levels" of the game, Kayla is asked to choose between a blue door or a red one, with no other information. It reminded me of the first text-based video game I wrote when I was 7, which was just a collection of random scenarios where every path ultimately ended with the player being eaten by a tiger.

The climax sees Kayla facing off with a previous player (who we are introduced to in the opening scene, but learn very little about). At this point a moral is shoehorned in about white male entitlement in videogaming - which would be a fine moral if it wasn't introduced so late and handled so clumsily.

I did like the grungy 80's aesthetic, and that it seemed almost self-aware about how played out that kind of nostalgia is at this point. Also Asa Butterfield is great as a basement-dwelling retro video gaming obsessive. I do love me some Asa Butterfield...
