Summary: Results for Ludum Dare 48 are out, and I did less well than last time!
Status: published

Ludum Dare 48 results are out a while now, but I forgot to post about them. I did not do as well as last time, but since my [results for Gophers]({filename}/gophers-results.md) were exceptional for me, that was probably to be expected. This time I placed 433rd overall, with the stand-out category being graphics, where I just about broke the top 100, at 99th place.

Category | Rating | Placing | Percentile
:--- | ---: | ---: | ---:
Overall | 3.81 | 433 | 84th
Fun | 3.259 | 1044 | 61st
Theme | 3.672 | 873 | 67th
Innovation | 3.345 | 754 | 72nd
Humor | 3.596 | 277 | 89th
Graphics | 4.466 | 99 | 96th
Audio | 3.621 | 526 | 80th
Mood | 3.846 | 460 | 83rd

## Graphs

A couple of graphs demonstrating my *trends*.

Still haven't surpassed that Rattendorf peak, *sigh*

## More Out of Gas

I am committed to working on a post-jam release of this game, as I think with a few tweaks and a bit more content it could be something quite special (more special than the ratings above suggest anyway!)

I will be posting here with development updates, and also over on the [itch.io](https://hyperlinkyourheart.itch.io/out-of-gas) page, where you can also still play the jam version for now.
