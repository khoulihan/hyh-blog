Summary: An animation of a cat hunting pixels on a 70's styled computer.

I put together an animation over the last few weeks of a cat trying to catch gliders on a 70's styled computer. Check it out on YouTube:

I actually only set out to draw the computer, and I'm not sure at what point the cat entered the picture, but I'm glad it did! My goal wasn't to depict any specific vintage computer, but to create a somewhat implausible one from imagination. I did look at a bunch of references for ideas on what to include, mostly from [oldcomputers.net](http://oldcomputers.net/)

## Music

I had originally planned to create a patch in VCVRack to accompany the animation, but I struggled to create something that felt right for the animation. Several attempts to create something in LMMS also failed. I ended up putting something together in [beepbox](https://beepbox.co/#8n51s6k0l00e0zt2mm0a7g0zj07i0r1o321440T1v2L4u25q1d5f7y0z8C0c0A5F4B0V1Q000dPc696E0018T1v1L4u63q1d5f7y1z7C1c0A1F1B4V1Q50b0Pea3bE0181T1v3L4u57q1d5f4y4z2C1c0A0F9B4V8Q0040P9900E0111T1v3L4ue1q3d7f7y2zbC0c0A0F0B7V1Q0000Pe600E0911T0v1L4ua7q3d6f8y4z1C0w0c1h0T3v1L4uf7q1d5f7y3z6C1SZIztrsrzrqiiiiibhkki4N8l0000018j4xkg4S00000g4x0j4xci4N0i41ci4Q00hkki4N8j4xci4N8j4xd5hm00000000004x8i4x8i4x800000000000000000018j4xci4M00000h4x4i000h4x4i4h800000p23GKrF-9isT7URQVH-p4U7CpKkVJvGBbXHKtSRnrARlLmrnZFdv_jvonQYPIyYLLKKYXZDvBCR-9jnUtc3onQYMcU_0rrupCh1KrhZGxqJQmVKfZ-PLMFKf-jTY3V2CnQUaD8S0sxdvVOILbOWrnUbYDcdvonVCmq_se_aKU_W-U_wuIXz_HW_TW_iL0arF-EvcBC8bwkRUwnFB0zhjhy9BV9EZELOjhOs25E5PYAmwk0).
