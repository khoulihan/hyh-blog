Autotiling is a great tool for laying out levels quickly while still having a high degree of polish - custom edges and corners - without having to manually place them. Ideal for game jams! However, I always struggle with how to approach designing tilesets that are suitable for autotiling, while ensuring they will work the way I want in Godot.
