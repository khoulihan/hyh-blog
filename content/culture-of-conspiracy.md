I recently read ["A Culture of Conspiracy"][1] by Professor Michael Barkun. In it, he describes several broad categories of conspiracist belief, and traces the development of a variety of beliefs from their origins through to the present day as they branch and mutate and recombine.

Anyway, here's my book report (or at least some of my thoughts, and probably some general rambling about conspiracism). I actually finished the book a while ago so hopefully I'm not misremembering anything here.

## Emergency Management

One of the things I was most eager to learn about from this book was FEMA camp conspiracy theories. I find these theories amongst the most frustrating (and amusing) because of how they look past the very real historical precedents of concentration camps, and the present day realities of mass incarceration and political repression in the United States and elsewhere, and focus instead on a long running conspiracy that is always just on the cusp of rounding up those troublesome "patriots".

Of course, the longer this conspiracy has been in the milieu the more absurd it becomes. Barkun identifies the origins of this theory as a pamphlet by a man named William Pabst, written sometime prior to 1979. Pabst warns: "your country and way of life [will be] replaced by a system in which you will be a slave in a concentration camp".

As such, more recent incarnations of this theory imply that the US government (or some secret group of conspirators, depending on the telling) has been building and maintaining a network of secret camps for *over 40 years* without ever putting their nefarious plans into motion!

Historical instances of the use of internment and concentration camps by governments are of course very real. However, they have never required such extensive periods of preparation. When the British government decided to round up Irish Nationalists in Northern Ireland, they built temporary structures in the weeks prior to doing so, and more permanent structures over the next few years after that. The United States forced 120,000 Japanese Americans into camps during WWII, first in hastily converted racetracks and fairgrounds, and then in more permanent facilities built over a few months in 1942. Even the horrifying machinery of the Nazis did not require decades to construct, instead comprising a mix of repurposed buildings of many types, and camps newly constructed during the course of the war - a system that imprisoned and exterminated millions.
