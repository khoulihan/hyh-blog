Summary: Belated art updates from the last 7 months.
Status: published

Once again I have become neglectful of updating this blog with my artwork, so let's do a roundup of the last uh... *7 months?!?!* and maybe I'll try to get it back on track from here on. Though I do have a nice [portfolio site][portfolio] now that I have been keeping up to date, so if you really like my art you could be following that as well. More on that below.

## Socialist Revolutionaries Past & Future

Last October I was trying to get back into the development of my game [Just a Robot][jar], and started as I always do by completely re-imagining its entire look. In this case I was inspired by the look of Soviet propaganda and Anarchist woodcuts.

I followed that up in December with this tribute to the luxurious moustache of Irish revolutionary socialist James Connolly.

## Spaaaace

For the New Year I committed myself to working on more space and sci-fi themed stuff. I started with this depiction of a space station roughly based on the ISS.

Also in January, a spaceship approaching Mercury, with some tricky perspective.

In February I did another piece loosely inspired by Soviet propaganda, and a theme that seemed to be somewhat controversial - the idea of billionaires fleeing into space and leaving the rest of us to our fates. Some people took that as a literal prediction of future events, but I think of it in more allegorical terms - capital is ruining the natural and social environment without any sense of responsibility to the rest of us, while its masters can escape the consequences of their actions without *literally leaving the planet* - depicting them doing so is just a good way of describing the situation, in my opinion.

In March I brought it back to Earth and explored the same theme from another perspective, more or less.

I started a piece in April for Cosmonautics day, but I didn't get it finished until June - the capsule and final stage of Vostok 1 in orbit. I did a [game jam][oog] and an [oil painting][oils] in the meantime though!

And that pretty much brings us up to date!

## Portfolio

[My portfolio site][portfolio], which went live in July 2020, is another statically-generated site based on [Pelican][pelican], but focused on image galleries instead of blog entries (using the standard gallery plugin). I wanted a central place to put my art that wasn't a social media platform, and that would display it optimally. I've linked to it a few times from here despite never actually mentioning it.

It is inspired by the ideas of Matej Jan on [displaying art on the internet][display], and attempts to display my pieces at the best integer scaling to fit in the browser window, on a background with appropriate contrast, and with no distractions.

Of course, I also wanted to keep it as small and responsive as possible, so it does this with about 3kB of javascript, 11kB of CSS, and a selection of minimal SVG backgrounds. Because all the art is pixel art, transferring it at 1x resolution and resizing it in the browser (as discussed in [recent][energy1] [posts][energy2]) keeps things extremely compact, with the entire portfolio currently only amounting to 390kB. The portfolio does a lot better job of displaying the art than this blog does though, here the images are just resized to max width without attempting an integer scaling.

I think it looks real nice and that my art looks real nice on it, so [go check it out!][portfolio]
