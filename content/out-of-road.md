I don't remember where I got the inspiration for this one. I guess I've been thinking a lot about climate change recently, what with the great crypto/NFT debates earlier in the year and recent extreme weather events and wildfires. It seems particularly timely given the recent [IPCC report](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/new-ipcc-climate-report-is-the-clearest-guidebook-for-selecting-a-future/ "IPCC report").

In terms of technique, I used a 3D render as a base, which is something I've done before, but this time I used somebody else's CC licensed model because cars are kinda complex.
