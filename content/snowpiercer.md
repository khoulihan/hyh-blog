I'm not sure what to make of the TV incarnation of Snowpiercer so far. The movie was decent enough, if a little too on-the-nose, so the idea of exploring its ideas with a little more nuance seems appealing. The internet was upset to learn that one of the main characters is a cop, and that much of the plot revolves around a murder mystery, but that seems to be more of a means to allow a character from the tail to move freely through the train than anything else.
