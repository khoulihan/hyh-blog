Only a few days after the last inspiring pixel dailies prompt, another one appeared that I couldn't resist - "Celestial". I had three ideas for it immediately but I only had time to do the one above on the day. I'm glad I spaced them out anyway because I think I achieved a lot with the extra time.

The second idea I worked on was originally only a planet-rise over some mountains, but it evolved quite a bit as I worked on it until it was about spaceships racing over a peaceful alien village.

I'm quite pleased with the palette and animation on this one.

The final concept I only completed yesterday, a view of the night sky through some trees.
